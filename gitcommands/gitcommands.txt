git init	--> initialize the repo
##git is only in the local device, to upload into github, you need to have a repository in it. We use git init to initialize git on the device

git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
git remote set-url origin https://[token]@github.com/<username>/<reponame>
## Running the commands inside the repo changes git push such that you don't need to enter username and token every time
