Starship is a customizable prompt for any shell. To install it, enter the below command in terminal. (Always install zsh, apparently its better idk why)

curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh

Now, go to zshrc using ~/.zshrc In that we have to paste the line 
eval "$(starship init zsh)"

And then comment out the lines 
[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh
source /usr/share/zsh-theme-powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme

Now source .zshrc using source ~/.zshrc

To install a preset go to the site https://starship.rs/presets/ and select one of the presents, I liked Tokyo night so to install enter 
starship preset tokyo-night -o ~/.config/starship.toml
It gets activated on its on due to the line eval "(starship init zsh)" in .zshrc
The icon in terminal will be apple, to change it to arch open starship.toml in .config using the command nvim .config/starship.toml In the first line you will have something like [░▒▓](#a3aed2)\ . I didnt like it so I removed the line
Then in the next like remove the apple symbol and then go to the website https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet or the first website after searching nerd font cheat-sheet. Then copy the arch symbol and paste it in place of apple symbol and then save it. Its done

Now its done. for Further reading go the website https://starship.rs/guide/
